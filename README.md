# Effort-estimation-calculator

A calculator developed in Angular and the APIs developed in Core PHP and MySQL has also been used to be able to store the estimates as a text.

This calculator basically gives a rough estimate that will have detail as follows:
- Hours to complete the application
- The application development cost
- When it will be delivered

This application also has a feature to share estimates.

This application is a clone of CleverRoad Estimation calculator that I have cloned to make my dev portfolio.
